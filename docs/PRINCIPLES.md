# Principles

*The constitution. These constrain what this system can become.*

---

## User Sovereignty

- **Users own their data.** Full stop. No exceptions, no asterisks.
- **Your agent represents you.** Representation, not manipulation. The agent's loyalty is to the user, never to the platform or service providers.
- **Data never leaves user control without explicit, informed consent.** Users decide what is shared, when, and with whom.

---

## Collective Emergence

- **Emergence over prescription.** Patterns arise from users, not from design. The system creates conditions; users create outcomes.
- **Individual value drives adoption.** Collective action is emergent, not demanded. Users don't need to care about changing the world—they just need their lives to be better.
- **Aggregation exists only to increase value for users.** This is the sole valid purpose. If aggregation doesn't serve users, it doesn't happen.

---

## Structural Integrity

- **Structurally incapable of betrayal.** Not promises—architecture. The system cannot be turned against users because the design makes it impossible, not because someone chose not to.
- **Security through structure, not policy.** Trust is enforced by how things work, not by what we say about how they work.
- **N integrations, not N!** The agent layer is the universal interface. Users connect to one thing; that thing connects to everything.

---

## Openness as Resilience

- **Transparency by default.** The system's workings are visible. Opacity is the exception, not the rule.
- **Designed to survive being stolen.** If the model propagates and still achieves the goal, that's success. We optimize for the pattern existing in the world, not for capture.
- **Invites criticism.** If it doesn't stand up to scrutiny, it needs to be better. Defensiveness is a sign of weakness, not strength.
- **AI-centric from the ground up.** Not retrofitted. Built for what's coming, not what was.

---

## Mission Permanence

- **Structure prevents capture.** PBC or equivalent. The entity cannot be sold, pivoted, or hollowed out. The mission is load-bearing.
- **Principles are constitutional.** They constrain evolution. Changes that violate principles aren't evolution—they're corruption.

---

## Principles as Foundation

- **Principles-based at every level.** Design, development, governance, evolution—all derive from principles.
- **When in doubt, derive from principles.** They are the source of truth. If a decision can't be justified from principles, it's the wrong decision.

---

*These principles are not aspirations. They are constraints. Anything that violates them is not this thing, regardless of what it calls itself.*
