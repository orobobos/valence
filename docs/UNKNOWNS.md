# Known Unknowns

*What we don't know yet. Honesty about gaps is itself a principle.*

## Sustainability

**The question:** How does this survive economically without compromising principles?

**Current thinking:**
- User payment for direct value (if compelling enough)
- Ethical B2B models (details TBD)
- Benefactors / mission-aligned funding
- Interpretability contributions as potential value generation
- PBC structure preserves mission regardless of revenue model

**What needs work:**
- Concrete revenue model that scales
- Alignment between revenue and user value (not tension)
- Runway to reach sustainability

**Principle constraint:** Revenue cannot come from sources that compromise user sovereignty or enable aggregation for non-user-benefit purposes.

## Knowledge Base Mechanics

**The question:** How does the agent actually learn about the user?

**Current thinking:**
- User-owned data populates knowledge base
- AI-native design (interpretability tie-ins)
- Progressive learning from interaction
- User controls what the agent knows and can infer

**Progress made:**
- Modular schema architecture (core, conversations, embeddings)
- Multi-scale conversation tracking (micro/meso/macro)
- Multi-provider embedding registry with fallback strategy
- Schema/data separation supporting cloud migration
- KB scopes defined: Personal, Project, Agent

**What needs work:**
- ~~Technical architecture for knowledge representation~~ (in progress)
- Privacy-preserving learning mechanisms
- User-understandable transparency into what agent "knows"
- Interpretability integration specifics
- Native embeddings vs external provider tradeoffs
- Cloud service architecture for multi-client access

**Principle constraint:** The knowledge base is the user's. The agent learns from it; it doesn't extract from it.

## Agent-User Trust Verification

**The question:** How does a user verify their agent is actually aligned to them?

**Current thinking:**
- Auditability by design
- Transparency into agent reasoning
- User can inspect what agent does on their behalf

**What needs work:**
- Concrete mechanisms for verification
- Balance between transparency and usability
- What "aligned to user" means operationally

**Principle constraint:** Trust must be earned and verifiable, not assumed.

## Adoption Path

**The question:** What's the wedge? What's valuable enough at small scale?

**Current thinking:**
- Individual value must drive adoption (not altruism)
- The collective action benefits are emergent
- Early users need immediate, tangible value

**Progress made:**
- Dogfooding: Chris is user #1, using Valence to build Valence
- MVP focus: automated development and project management
- The development process IS the first instantiation of Valence principles
- Aggregation at N=1 is direct; architecture supports N>1

**What needs work:**
- ~~Specific value proposition for user #1~~ (in progress via dogfooding)
- Value proposition for users #2 through user #10,000
- The feature or capability that's compelling without network effects
- Growth strategy that doesn't compromise principles

**Principle constraint:** Adoption comes from value to users, not from lock-in or manipulation.

---

## Scope and Boundaries

**The question:** What is this, and what is it not?

**Current thinking:**
- It's not everything yet
- It becomes what users need it to become
- Boundaries emerge from principles, not from predetermined scope

**What needs work:**
- Clearer articulation of initial scope
- What's explicitly out of scope and why
- How scope evolves governed by principles

**Principle constraint:** Scope is constrained by principles, not by ambition.

---

## Timing

**The question:** Does this have runway before the landscape shifts?

**Current thinking:**
- The goal is seeding the pattern
- If it exists when things reorganize, it can grow
- Speed matters, but not at the cost of principles

**What needs work:**
- Realistic timeline to MVP
- What "MVP" actually means for this
- Contingencies if the landscape shifts faster than expected

**Principle constraint:** We move fast, but we don't compromise the seed.

---

## The Name

**The question:** What is this called?

**Current thinking:**
- Name comes after identity is clear
- The name should reflect principles, not marketing

**What needs work:**
- Know what it is well enough to name it

*These unknowns are not weaknesses to hide. They're work to be done. Documenting them honestly is how we hold ourselves accountable to figure them out.*
